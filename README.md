# BMOS

This repo will eventually store two copies of SD card images:

## EV3 BMOS

EV3 BMOS is a revised copy of the [EV3 MicroPython SD card image](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3/). This image includes the BrickMMO [ev3-python](https://github.com/BrickMMO/ev3-python) script and includes the following features:

- Automatic updates
- Automatic restarts
- Automatic pairing of new Spike, EV3, and BrickPi hubs
- Automatic sharing of Wifi credentials
- Dissemination of Spike hubs instructions

## BrickPi BMOS

Same features as EV3 BMOS except uses the [Raspian for Robots image](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/install-raspbian-for-robots-image-on-an-sd-card/). This image includers the BrickMMO [brickpi-python](https://github.com/BrickMMO/brickpi-python).

## Spike BMOS

The Spike hubs do not include an SD card slot. The same features are included in a [spike-python](https://github.com/BrickMMO/spike-python) script that needs to be manually added to each hub.
